**Abstract:** This paper surveys visual odometry technology for unmanned systems. Visual odometry is one of the most important technologies to implement vision-based navigation; therefore, it is widely applied to unmanned systems in recent years. Visual odometry estimates a trajectory and a pose of the system, and it could be classified into the following: 1) stereo vs. monocular, 2) feature-based or indirect vs. direct, and 3) linear vs. nonlinear based on the number of cameras, information attributes, and the optimization process, respectively. In the paper, we discuss the state-of-the-art issues of research activities related to visual odometry and summarize future direction for the research.
