**Abstract:** Disclosed is an ego motion estimation method and apparatus, wherein the apparatus calculates a scene flow field from a plurality of spaces of an input image, clusters the plurality of spaces based on a scene flow, updates a probability vector map for clustered spaces, identifies a stationary background based on the updated probability vector map, and estimates ego motion information based on the identified stationary background.
