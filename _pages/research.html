<p> In September 2022, I started working for Samsung Electronics in the System LSI business, Device Solution Division. My current responsibility involves evaluating and validating the iToF sensor. This sensor uses an infrared pulse to measure the phase difference between the pulse and its reflection, which in turn produces a frame-based depthmap. </p>
<p> Back in the Spring of 2015, I joined <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> (formerly known as ICSL) at Seoul National University to conduct research in Robotics. I collaborated with <a href="https://mpil.sookmyung.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Pyojin Kim</a>, <a href="http://blog.naver.com/rlackd93/" target="_blank">Changhyeon Kim</a>, <a href="http://haram-kim.github.io/" target="_blank">Haram Kim</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7pvJoZoAAAAJ" target="_blank">Youngseok Jang</a>, and my research interests in robotics focused on the areas of 3D Vision, particularly on Robust Visual Odometry in Dynamic Environments [<a href="/2019-11-05-robust-real-time-rgb-d-visual-odometry-in-dynamic-environments-via-rigid-motion-model/">1</a>, <a href="/2017-10-06-realtime-rigid-motion-segmentation-using-grid-based-optical-flow/">2</a>], and Applications for Event Camera [<a href="/2019-09-10-edge-detection-for-event-cameras-using-intra-pixel-area-events/">3</a>], as well as 2D Vision [<a href="/2016-10-17-exposure-correction-and-image-blending-for-planar-panorama-stitching/">4</a>]. </p>
